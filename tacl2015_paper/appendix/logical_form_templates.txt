# Templates for semantic analysis.
#
# Each row of the lexicon represents a particular rule that is invoked when:
# 1. any of the space-separated regular expressions in the first column matches the lowercased word
# 2. the syntactic category matches the second column
# When a rule is invoked, the lambda calculus formula in the third column is
# inserted into the CCG parse tree for the word. <lc_word> is replaced in the logical
# form by the lowercased word that is matched. <arg_i> is replaced by the lowercased 
# word that is the i'th argument to the syntactic category. The fourth column of these
# entries can be ignored.

# The templates for binary and unary rules provide additional analyses for
# absorbing punctuation, appositives and conjunctions.
